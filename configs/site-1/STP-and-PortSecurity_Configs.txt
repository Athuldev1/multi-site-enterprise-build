🟦 1. STP – Major Configuration Commands to Capture
🔹 Global STP Mode (Must-have)
spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst


Why:
Defines convergence behavior and per-VLAN instances. This is a design decision, not a default you want hidden.

🔹 Root Bridge Intent (Even if single switch)
spanning-tree vlan 10,20,999 priority 24576


(or)

spanning-tree vlan 10,20,999 root primary


Why:
This makes root bridge placement explicit.
Future switches won’t accidentally win root due to a lower MAC.

🔹 Access Port Hardening (STP Safety)
spanning-tree portfast default
spanning-tree bpduguard default


Why:
These two lines scream enterprise best practice.
They prevent accidental loops from user ports.


🟦 2. Port Security – Major Commands to Capture


🔹 Typical Secure Access Port Template
interface fastEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 switchport port-security mac-address sticky
 switchport port-security violation restrict


Why each line matters:

port-security → enables feature

maximum 2 → user + phone (realistic)

sticky → auto-learns MACs (less ops pain)

restrict → logs & drops instead of nuking the port

This is very interview-friendly config.

🔹 Optional: Shutdown Mode (More Aggressive)
switchport port-security violation shutdown


Use this only if you want zero tolerance (labs, secure zones).


🟦 3. Verification Commands (Document Output, Not Config)

You don’t commit these as config, but you capture outputs in markdown files.

🔹 STP Verification
show spanning-tree
show spanning-tree summary

🔹 Port Security Verification
show port-security
show port-security interface fastEthernet0/1


Why:
These prove your config is working, not just typed.
