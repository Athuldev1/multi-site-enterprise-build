# Multi-Site Enterprise Build

A comprehensive, modular, and scalable enterprise network and automation project designed to simulate real-world multi-site enterprise infrastructure. This project demonstrates hands-on knowledge in **networking, cloud integration, automation, and enterprise-level best practices**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides a **hands-on blueprint** for building, managing, and automating enterprise networks across multiple sites. It covers core areas including:

- **Network Design & Implementation**: Routing, switching, VLANs, OSPF, BGP  
- **Automation & Scripting**: Python automation for repetitive network tasks  
- **Security & Monitoring**: Basic firewall policies, logs, and network health monitoring  
- **Documentation & Reporting**: Clear project documentation and visualization of network topology  
- **Scalable Multi-Site Architecture**: Simulated multi-branch enterprise connectivity for learning real-world deployment
